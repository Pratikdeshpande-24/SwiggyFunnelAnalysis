# Swiggy Funnel Analysis

## Business Case
Swiggy, a leading food e-commerce platform, serves over 1 million users daily. In this project, we took on the role of a Growth and Strategy Analyst to analyze Swiggyâ€™s performance for the year 2019. We utilized the "Funnel Case Study Data" workbook, which includes three worksheets:

1. **Session Details**: Contains date-wise session counts, including listing sessions, menu sessions, cart sessions, payment sessions, and order sessions.

2. **Channel-wise Traffic**: Provides a breakdown of traffic (listing sessions) by channel at the date level.

3. **Supporting Data**: Offers additional date-level information that may assist in solving the case, with column descriptions provided.

## Analysis Overview
- Evaluated the changes in order volumes using the Session Details sheet and investigated the reasons behind these variations.
- Completed the Session Details sheet by filling in all remaining columns based on the provided column definitions.
- Identified dates with significant highs and lows in orders compared to the same day in the previous week.
- Analyzed the overall conversion funnel by breaking it down into the following metrics:
  - **L2M** (Listing to Menu)
  - **M2C** (Menu to Cart)
  - **C2P** (Cart to Payment)
  - **P2O** (Payment to Order)
- Detected fluctuations in conversion rates and explored potential causes.
- Formulated hypotheses to explain the observed fluctuations in conversions.
